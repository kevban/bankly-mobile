## What does Bank.ly do?

Bank.ly is a personal finance management tool that helps users keep track of their financial transactions and spending habits.

Users can also create custom tags and categories to better organize their transactions and view detailed spending reports. Additionally, the app is designed to be cross-platform compatible, allowing users to access their financial information on the go.
